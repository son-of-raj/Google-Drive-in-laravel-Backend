# Laravel & Google Drive Storage

## Getting your Root Folder ID

If you want to store files in your Google Drive root directory, then the folder ID can be `null`. Else go into your Drive and create a folder.

Because Google Drive allows duplicate names, it identifies each file and folder with a unique ID. If you open your folder, you will see the **Folder ID** in the URL.
